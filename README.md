# Recipesapp

App made for studying Vue.js
It's a little app for recipe search by the ingredient.

The deployment: https://evnayd.github.io/Recipesapp/
The application has a responsive design. 
I used Vue.js, Vue CLI, CSS, API: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php.



Scenario: the user clicks on the search button, an API request is made, a list of recipes with this ingredient is returned.
When the user clicks on "the see the recipe button", a request is made to the API (using the ID of a specific recipe), a popup appears with the data of a specific recipe.
The popup is closed by clicking on the "close" button or by clicking on the background of the popup.
If an ingredient is entered incorrectly or there are no recipes with such an ingredient, an error message appears.
